# helloWorld.js
A simple JS calculator app I am building to practice TDD and making us of Node.js
modules.

## dependencies

  * [**Mocha**](http://mochajs.org) for running tests via the command line

    * [**Chai**](http://chaijs.com) assertion library. I decided to use the *Should* 
      style of assertion. I found it the most readable.
